# Computer Vision Programming
Contains main files and supporting files for computer vision.


### Basic computer vision with OpenCV and its pre-trained models
Computer vision file (opens images and videos) and displays visualizations from the camera connected to the device.

Several configuration files and pre-trained models (in this repository using YOLO).

### Implicit in deep learning (Finished file)
In essence, this repository contains implementations of deep learning (object detection) programs whose datasets have been trained previously. So, just download and try it :)
